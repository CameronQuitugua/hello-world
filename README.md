This is the my first git repository of my own making.

# About My Self
As of right now, I am in my spring semester of my sophomore year. I am currectly 18 years old and I live in Nampa, ID. Before I moved here, I lived in O'ahu for a good 14 years, and before that, I lived in Guam for a short while. I like to cook and I love jiu-jitsu, but I don't really have the time for either because I am swamped from all my classes.
